h1. About

This is my ~/.vim folder I use on every computer I touch. I have successfully
set it up on the following systems:

* Linux
* Mac OSX
* Windows (yep, you heard right)

It's based of scrooloose's vimfiles (http://github.com/scrooloose/vimfiles) and
I pull frequently from his repo, but it is not an actual fork.

I use to develop using:

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* Javascript
* Python
* HTML
* CSS
* HAML
* SASS
* Less
* And others (Mostly Web Development)

It includes plugins that I find most useful. Some of them:

* AlignMapsPlugin.vim
* AlignPlugin.vim
* bufexplorer.vim
* camelcasemotion.vim
* command-t.vim
* CSApprox.vim
* endwise.vim
* fugitive.vim
* gist.vim
* grep.vim
* IndexedSearch.vim
* jsbeautify.vim
* matchit.vim
* NERD_commenter.vim
* NERD_tree.vim
* pastie.vim
* ragtag.vim
* rails.vim
* rubyredgreen.vim
* ruby_single_test.vim
* snipMate.vim
* surround.vim
* syntastic.vim
* taglist.vim

Currently I don't have an easy way of updating all of these plugins, I usually
do it either manually or being lucky that after a pull from scrooloose some of
them got updated :).

h1. Installation/Usage

Clone this repo into your home directory either as .vim (linux) or vimfiles (MF
Windows).

Then cd into the repo and run this to get the snippets submodule:

<pre><code>
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

Put this in your vimrc along with your personal hacks:
<pre><code>
source ~/.vim/vimrc      "linux
source ~/vimfiles/vimrc  "windows
</code></pre>

Optionally you can also symlink my own .vimrc:

<pre><code>
ln -s ~/.vim/dot_vimrc ~/.vimrc
</pre></code>
