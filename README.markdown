My Vimfiles
===========

This is my ~/.vim folder I use on every computer I touch. I have successfully
set it up on the following systems:

* Linux
* Mac OSX
* Windows (yep, you heard right)

I use to develop using:

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* Javascript
* Python
* HTML
* CSS
* HAML
* SASS
* Less
* And others (Mostly Web Development)

It includes plugins that I find most useful. Some of them:

* ack
* align
* autoclose
* bufexplorer
* camelcasemotion
* Command-T
* CSApprox
* cucumber
* endwise
* fugitive
* gist
* git
* haml
* indent_object
* IndexedSearch
* javascript
* jsbeautify
* markdown
* markdown_preview
* nerdcommenter
* nerdtree
* ragtag
* rails
* rake
* rspec
* Ruby-Single-Test
* snipmate
* supertab
* surround
* Syntastic
* taglist
* textile
* unimpaired

All these are actually git submodules, so updating should be as easy as running

    git submodule update
